Supercapacitor Charging Circuit using Transistors/MOSFETs
=========================================================

This circuit is a basic example of a supercapacitor charging circuit using NPN transistor and diodes, designed for easy understanding and demonstration purposes. It may not be suitable for precise and efficient use.

Specifications
--------------
- Input voltage: 3V
- Input current: 10A
- Charging current: 5A
- Supercapacitor details: 100F, 2.7V rated

Circuit Description
-------------------
- Three switching diodes (1N4148) are connected in series to provide a voltage drop of 2.0V-2.5V at 50A, ensuring that the voltage across the supercapacitor never exceeds the maximum rating.
- A 1K ohm potentiometer is used to set the base voltage for the NPN transistor, and a capacitor with 0.1uF is connected to the base to act as a filter.
- A resistor in the emitter leg is used to set the charging current at 50mA. The value of the emitter resistor is calculated as 1.65V / 33 Ohm = 50mA.
- The supercapacitor acts as a local reservoir of charge.
- The voltage across the supercapacitor will ramp up at a linear rate until the clamp diodes start to draw some of the current that was going into the supercapacitor. At this point, the rate of change of voltage will start to level off.

Calculation
-----------
- Capacitance of the supercapacitor (C) = 100F, 2.7V
- Change in voltage (dv) = 2.45V
- Charging current (I) = 50mA
- Time taken to charge (dt) = (C * dv) / I = (100F * 2.45V) / 0.05A = 4900 seconds = 82 minutes

Note: The calculated time may vary depending on the specific conditions and components used.

Limitations
-----------
- The circuit may not be precise and efficient for practical use.
- The components used in this circuit may not be sufficient to safely pass a larger current.
- The resistor in the emitter leg may need to be changed to a lower value with a higher power rating.
- The capacitor may have some leakage that can discharge the supercapacitor over time.
