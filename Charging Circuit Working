Supercapacitor charging circuit based on transistors/MOSFETs, with the following constraints,

1. Input specifications: 3V 10A

2. Charging current = 5A

3. Supercapacitor detalls: 100F, 2.7V rated.


this here is a simple supercapacitor charging circuit designed and built around 2N3904 NPN transistor, 
50 mA constant current will be used through supercapacitor(100F,2.7V) as we charge it.
Benefit of using constant current is the voltage will ramp up at a linear rate and will have a predictable charge time which can be verified.
Voltage rating on supercapacitor(2.7V) cannot  exceed as it might result in explosion of the particular circuit.

Circuit Working:

In this circuit , 3 Switching Diodes IN4148 are connected in series which gives a voltage drop of 2.V-2.5V at 50A , 
this will ensure that the voltage across the supercapacitor never exceeds the maximum rating .Supercapacitor acts as a local reservoir of charge.

Energy Stored: 
	E = (1/2) * (100F)*(2.7V)
	E = 365 J or Joules

To set current , a constant voltage on the base of NPN transistor is applied through 1K Ohm Potentiometer and is also connected with a 
filter using a capacitor with 0.1uF to keep it stable. 
Potentiometer which is used sets the Base Voltage for NPN transistor 
Capacitor is connected to base to act as a filter.
Value of voltage measured at emitter resistor is 1.65V.
Value of voltage measured at the clamp(diodes) is 2.5V, which is used in the formula.

For a manual verification i.e on circuit board this will be measured without the supercapacitor.

Once the Supercapacitor(100F) is connected in the circuit ,time is measured to reach 2.45V(charging).
As the graph says there should be voltage ramp up which should be fairly linear when we solve for the equation.
Rate of change of voltage starts to level because the clamp(diodes) starts to draw some of the current that was going into the supercapacitor.
This part of the graph will not be linear as it flattens out.
The necessary calculation for the estimated time to charge the supercapacitor is show below:

In this circuit potentiometer will be adjusted until we get 1.65V at the emitter

1.65V / 33 Ohm = 50mA

As long as we have 1.65V at the emitter resistor (Re) we will have 50mA in the emitter most of that will be collector current(Ic) ,
base current (Ib) will be insignificant

If we rework the equation;

 	I = C* (dv/dt)

	C = 100F, 2.7V
	dv- change in voltage = 2.45V
	I = 50mA

====> 	dt = (C) * (dv) / dt
    	dt = (100F)*(2.45V) / 0.05A

   	dt = 4900 seconds = 82 mins 

//
Similarly, for example if a supercapacitor of value 10F,2.7V for the same design and calculations ,time taken to charge is close to 8.2 mins.
//

//* A precise and efficient circuit can be built with neccessary specifications.
This circuit is not precise and is basic for easy understanding and the measured values can vary based on the conditions and it is
demonstrated only for the purpose of this questions and due lack of required library required to run the circuit simulation on LTspice *//

//
The 2N3904 transistor and the 1N4148 diodes in this example will not be sufficient for a precise circuit ,
you will need to select components that can safely pass the larger current, you will need to sink a constant charge current . 
The resistor in the emitter leg will also need to be changed to a lower value with a higher power rating.
Also capacitor will have some leakage that may discharge battery over time.

Waveform:

This is the generic characteristic curve of transistor, if you vary collector voltage which happens concurrently
when the supercapacitor charges and collector current also varies a little bit ,
a slope can observed in the expected waveform.
As the graph says there should be voltage ramp up which should be fairly linear when we solve for the equation.
Rate of change of voltage starts to level because the clamp(diodes) starts to draw some of the current that was going into the supercapacitor. 
This part of the graph will not be linear as it flattens out.
